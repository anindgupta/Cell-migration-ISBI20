# Cell Migration Mode Prediction for High Magnification Images 

Cell migration is a complex and heterogeneous phenomenon consisting of many spatially and
temporally regulated mechanisms. 
A complete understanding of cell migration phenomenon is indeed crucial to derive an 
adequate quantification for single cell-based analysis. 
However, the spatiotemporal behavior of dynamic cells is often complex and challenging for 
manual classification and analysis.\,Automatized algorithms are thus highly 
desired to facilitate mesenchymal migration sub-modalities prediction. 
Supervised deep learning techniques have shown promising outcomes in microscopy image 
analysis. However, their implication is confided by the amount of carefully annotated data.
Weak supervision provides a simple, model-agnostic way to integrate the domain-expertise   
into a learning model. 
Additionally, bayesian predicitons can lead to a more informed decision, and the quality 
of prediction can be improved.
Currently, this study employs a CNN regression model for predicting (or classifying) the probability of each cell observation.
